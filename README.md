# ai-api-gateway
API Gateway that solves requests by mapping [OpenAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification) specification with [AI Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools.html).

Requests to the API Gateway are infered to the LLM model that determines the API to be called using the set of [AI Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools.html) defined from API Rest services.

1. Start Ollama server
```sh
ollama serve

# Pull the model llama3.1:8b (if necessary)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

2. Start dummy services to test `ai-api-gateway`
```sh
cd ecommerce-product
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ecommerce-booking
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. Start `ai-api-gateway`
```sh
cd ai-api-gateway
